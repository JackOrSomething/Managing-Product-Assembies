The zip contains 2 files here is how you access the code for each:

workspace.zip - Download the app connect enterprise toolkit from here https://www.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/iwm/web/dispatcher.do?source=swg-wmbfd.
Then place the contents of the zip to this file path C:\Users\[USERNAME]\IBM\ACET11\workspace, 
This will allow you to see how each document is related and how each flow procedes.
Secondly if you only want to see the indivudual ESQL files you may access them by simply navigating through the zip.

prod_db_schema - Download Mysql workbench and run the SQL file, other SQL clients may work but this has not been verified.
